    "<h2>About this Exercise</h2>\n",
    "<p>In the preceding activity, you derived a Euclidean distance matrix. Now that you have calculated the distance between points in terms of matrix operations, you are ready to write an efficient program that leverages NumPy's optimized functions. In this code exercise, rather than using loops, you will write a function to compute Euclidean distances between sets of vectors using NumPy functions.</p>\n",

    "<h3>Evaluation</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>You must complete this exercise in order to unlock the final project in this module. Your score on this assignment will not be included in the final grade calculation.</strong><p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>You are expected to write code where you see <em># YOUR CODE HERE</em> within the cells of this notebook. Not all cells will be graded; code input cells followed by cells marked with <em>#Autograder test cell</em> will be graded. Upon submitting your work, the code you write at these designated positions will be assessed using an \"autograder\" that will run all test cells to assess your code. You will receive feedback from the autograder that will identify any errors in your code. Use this feedback to improve your code if you need to resubmit. Be sure not to change the names of any provided functions, classes, or variables within the existing code cells, as this will interfere with the autograder. Also, remember to execute all code cells sequentially, not just those you’ve edited, to ensure your code runs properly.</p>\n",
    "    \n",

    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Save your notebook.</strong></li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Mark as Completed —</strong> In the blue menu bar along the top of this code exercise window, you’ll see a menu item called <strong>Education</strong>. In the <strong>Education</strong> menu, click <strong>Mark as Completed</strong> to submit your code for autograder/instructor review. This process will take a moment and a progress bar will show you the status of your submission.</li>\n",
    "\t<li><strong>Review your results —</strong> Once your work is marked as complete, the results of the autograder will automatically be presented in a new tab within the code exercise window. You can click on the assessment name in this feedback window to see more details regarding specific feedback/errors in your code submission.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Repeat, if necessary —</strong> The Jupyter notebook will always remain accessible in the first tabbed window of the exercise. To reattempt the work, you will first need to click <strong>Mark as Uncompleted</strong> in the <strong>Education</strong> menu and then proceed to make edits to the notebook. Once you are ready to resubmit, follow steps one through three. You can repeat this procedure as many times as necessary.</li>\n",

(Hint: Make sure that when you take the square root of the squared distance matrix, ensure that all entries are non-negative. Sometimes very small numvers can be non-negative due to numerical precision, you can just set them to 0.)</p>"
